# unscramble
simple word game where the user needs to unscramble the letters on screen within a time limit. [live site url](https://riqydev.github.io/unscramble/)]

# how to play
start typing to input a guess, if you're on mobile you will need to click on the empty box to bring the keyboard up.

start with 20s on the clock, each guess grants +15s. if the time runs out, game over. the correct word will be shown to you after you fail. personal best score will be saved. to start a new round, click on the boxes anywhere.

# why i made this
made in a day, just as practice. i also enjoy word games. code is probably messy to all hell.
